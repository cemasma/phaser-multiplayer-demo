# phaser-multiplayer-demo

This is a basic demonstration for how to make a real-time multiplayer browser game.
I used express for publishing game and beside that i used socket.io for real-time information flow.

## Usage
First you need to clone it.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cemasma/phaser-multiplayer-demo.git
```
If your computer has node.js already you should run this command on the project root directory.
```shell
npm install
```

When the modules are installed you can start it with this command.
```shell
npm start
```

For lastly you can access the game on: http://localhost:3000
