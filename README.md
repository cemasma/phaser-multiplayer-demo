# phaser-multiplayer-demo

This is a basic demonstration for how to make a multiplayer browser game.
I used express and socket.io libraries for giving an answer this question.

## Usage
First you need to clone it.
```shell
git clone gitadresi.git
```
After if your computer has node.js already you should run this command on the project root directory.
```shell
npm start
```

For lastly you should open this link on your browser: http://localhost:3000
